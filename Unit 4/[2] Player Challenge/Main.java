/*
You will write the Player class to represent users in a video game. The class will have the variables listed below. Some will be instance variables and some will be static. You must decide which is appropriate:

username - the name a user chooses
level - the numeric skill level of a player
numUsers - the current number of users online
isOnline - true or false whether the player is online
averageLevel - the average level of all the users currently online


You will create all methods that you believe are necessary to complete the class(i.e. constructor(s), getters, setters, toStringâ€¦). In addition to that you will write the following functions:

levelUp - player gains a level
logOn - if the user is not online they come online. If they are online an error message prints (think about what might need to update. Have a counter with the number of users online and increment as necessary.)
logOff - if the user is online they go offline. If they are offline an error message prints (think about what might need to update)
versus - this allows two players to challenge each other. The player with the higher level wins. The winner gains a level. The loser loses a level. Levels cannot fall below 0. (Use Math.random in this part!)


You should have a separate Driver class (Main.java) where you have a main method and show that you have tested all of these functions.
